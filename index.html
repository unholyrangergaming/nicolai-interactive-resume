    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Sophisticated & Energetic (Deep Base with Vibrant Accent)" -->
    <!-- Primary Background: #1a1a1a (Very dark grey/almost black) -->
    <!-- Main Text: #eceff1 (Very light grey for contrast) -->
    <!-- Accent: #00bfa5 (Bright Teal/Aqua) -->
    <!-- Secondary Backgrounds (e.g., cards): #263238 (Dark Blue Grey) -->
    <!-- Secondary Text/Details: #b0bec5 (Light Grey Blue) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed with a narrative flow. It starts with a strong hero section to introduce Nicolai. This is followed by an an interactive timeline for exploring his career journey, allowing users to see both the big picture and detailed role descriptions. A dedicated skills section uses a radar chart for a quick, visually engaging assessment of his core competencies. A "Personal Profile" section has been added to highlight his unique approach and motivations. Finally, a "Project Highlights" section acts as a portfolio, using cards to present key achievements in a digestible format. This structure was chosen to guide the user from a high-level summary to detailed evidence of his capabilities, making it more engaging than a linear CV. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Timeline (HTML/CSS/JS): Goal is to show career progression. An interactive vertical timeline is better than a list for showing the flow and duration of roles. Users can click to expand details, keeping the initial view clean.
        - Skills Radar Chart (Chart.js): Goal is to provide a quick, visually engaging assessment of his core competencies. A radar chart is effective for comparing multiple skills against each other and is more visually interesting than a simple list.
        - Project Cards (HTML/CSS/JS): Goal is to showcase specific, impactful achievements. A card-based layout allows for organizing diverse project information (problem, action, result) into scannable, visually appealing blocks. Each card now includes a small, thematic placeholder icon.
        - Text Blocks (HTML/JS): Goal is to provide context. Text is used for summaries and detailed descriptions, revealed on interaction to avoid overwhelming the user.
        - Personal Profile (HTML/CSS/JS): Goal is to convey Nicolai's unique approach and motivations. Presented as a concise text block for direct communication, now with a thematic image.
        - Hero Image (HTML/CSS): Goal is to create an immediate visual impact and set the professional tone.
        - Education Image (HTML/CSS): Goal is to add visual interest to the education section.

                        I am a results-driven professional, constantly seeking to prove value through tangible outcomes. My career has been shaped by embracing continuous challenge and deep reflection, cultivating an insatiable drive for progress and mastery. I am committed to delivering consistently high-standard execution, earning trust and respect through impactful contributions. My internal compass is calibrated for performance, constantly seeking to exceed expectations and drive initiatives to successful completion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My true differentiator lies in my proven ability to rapidly gain deep, internal understanding of complex organizationsâ€”their intricate processes, unique challenges, and untapped opportunities. Having collaborated extensively with technical engineers on development projects and managed programs from financial analysts to VPs, I've cultivated an unparalleled insight into navigating organizational dynamics and uncovering "unknown pitfalls." This skill, honed through extensive internal networking and cross-functional engagement, allows me to quickly assimilate new contexts, lead through influence by mastering complex stakeholder dynamics (utilizing a "hat" methodology to anticipate perspectives), communicate effectively across all levels, and implement impactful, sustainable solutions with exceptional speed and effectiveness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion is rooted in driving meaningful change and contributing directly to strategic growth and digital transformation within organizations. I am a proponent of structured communication, believing in clear, concise frameworks to solve complex problems and present insights effectively. My journey is one of continuous learning and cross-collaboration, always seeking the "why" behind challenges to create impactful solutions. The prospect of mentorship from experienced leaders is a significant motivator, and a crucial step towards my long-term aspiration of becoming a McKinsey Consultant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thrive on challenge, viewing every obstacle as an. opportunity for growth and enhanced performance. While I continuously seek development, I also recognize the importance of strategic recovery, understanding that sustained excellence requires both relentless pursuit and purposeful balance. My ultimate goal is to contribute to building impactful solutions that drive significant organizational transformation and strategic advantage. I am driven to prove my capability within leading, dynamic professional environments.
